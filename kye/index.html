                <p>
                  Kyeji Nakazawa — or just Kye — grew up between cultures, born in Okayama, Japan, and raised in the Philippines. He’s not the loudest in the room, but when he's comfortable, the charm switches on fast. He jokes easily, plays around a lot, and gives off a warm, inviting energy that puts people at ease. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Kye’s life isn’t about big drama — it’s about small joys. Basketball games with friends, quiet hours spent gaming, cuddling with pets, or just catching up on sleep. He’s that kind of person: laid-back, steady, always ready with a quip or two when the mood calls for it. If he's surrounded by good people, good snacks, and his favorite hoodie, he's golden.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He doesn’t chase attention, but people gravitate toward him anyway. Maybe it’s his sense of humor. Maybe it's the way he listens. Or maybe it’s because under his playful vibe, there’s a thoughtful side — someone who notices things, who reflects more than he lets on, and who holds on tightly to the people and memories that matter.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He’s a student now at FEU Institute of Technology, majoring in Mobile and Web Application Development — and while school keeps him busy, he still finds time to chill, laugh, and sneak in a few late-night game sessions. Rainbow sherbet is his go-to treat (mint chocolate? absolutely not), and nothing beats a hot bowl of ramyeon after a long day.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Kye likes the cold — winter and spring are his favorite seasons. There's something about the calm of it all, the way the world softens. Purple and ivory feel like home to him. And if there's one thing he lives by, it’s simple:

                <p>
                  <em>“Let’s live diligently as life passes by.”</em>
